REGISTRY SECRETS
The --registry-secrets option specifies a JSON or YAML file containing private
Docker registry usernames and passwords to be used when pulling base images.
Sample registry-secrets YAML file:

	'my-registry-server.com:25000':
		username: ann
		password: hunter2
	'':  # Use the empty string to refer to the Docker Hub
		username: mike
		password: cze14
	'eu.gcr.io':  # Google Container Registry
		username: '_json_key'
		password: '{escaped contents of the GCR keyfile.json file}'

For a sample project using registry secrets with the Google Container Registry,
check: https://github.com/balena-io-playground/sample-gcr-registry-secrets

If the --registry-secrets option is not specified, and a secrets.yml or
secrets.json file exists in the balena directory (usually $HOME/.balena),
this file will be used instead.`;

DOCKERIGNORE AND GITIGNORE FILES
By default, the balena CLI will use a single ".dockerignore" file (if any) at
the project root (source directory) in order to decide which source files to
exclude from the "build context" sent to balenaCloud, Docker daemon or
balenaEngine. In a microservices (multicontainer) application, the source
directory is the directory that contains the "docker-compose.yml" file.

The --multi-dockerignore (-m) option may be used with microservices (multicontainer)
applications that define a "docker-compose.yml" file. When this option is used,
each service subdirectory (defined by the 'build' or 'build.context' service
properties in the docker-compose.yml file) will be filtered separately according
the .dockerignore file (if any) defined at the service subdirectory. If no
.dockerignore file exists at the service subdirectory, then only the default
.dockerignore patterns (see below) will apply for that service subdirectory.

When the --multi-dockerignore (-m) option is used, the .dockerignore file (if
any) defined at the overall project root will not have any effect on service
subdirectories, whether or not a service subdirectory defines its own
.dockerignore file. Multiple .dockerignore files are not "merged" or "added
together" and cannot override or extend other files. This behavior maximises
compatibility with the standard docker-compose tool, while still allowing a
root .dockerignore file (at the overall project root) to filter files and
folders that are outside service subdirectories.

Balena CLI releases older than v12.0.0 also took '.gitignore' files into account.
This behavior is deprecated, but may still be enabled with the --gitignore (-g)
option if compatibility is required. This option is mutually exclusive with
--multi-dockerignore (-m) and will be removed in the CLI's next major version
release (v13).

Default .dockerignore patterns
When --gitignore (-g) is NOT provided (i.e. when not in v11 compatibility mode),
a few hardcoded dockerignore patterns are also used and "merged" (in memory)
with the patterns found in the applicable '.dockerignore' file (if any), in
the following order:
\`\`\`
    **/.git
    < user's patterns from the applicable '.dockerignore' file, if any >
    !**/.balena
    !**/.resin
    !**/Dockerfile
    !**/Dockerfile.*
    !**/docker-compose.yml
\`\`\`
If necessary, the effect of the '**/.git' pattern may be modified by adding
"counter patterns" to the '.dockerignore' file, for example '!service1/.git'.
For documentation on pattern format, see:
- https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file
